# Quick-tutorials-for-PyTorch
This is just a refresher on PyTorch before taking any deep learning project. These notebooks will be constantly updated and may overlap to some degree. 

## Notebooks

1. [Introduction to tensors](Tensors.ipynb)
    - Introduction to tensors
    - Basic operations
    - Broadcasting rules

2. [Building Your First Neural Network](First_Neural_Network.ipynb)
    - Basic structures
    - nn.Module, optimisers, In-built Loss functions
    - Notes on gradient calculation
 
3. [Convolutions](Convolutions.ipynb)
   - Convolution as Linear Transformation
   - Strides and Dialations
   - Padding
   - Channels
   - ConvTranspose

I think we are more than equipped (from a PyTorch coding perspective) to implement and discuss the underlying architectural choices made in the seminal work in image segmentation titled [UNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) 

4. UNET (upcoming)
